- wrote `read_srad.py` to read solar radiation data from [National Data Buoy Center](http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/). The specific node I used was [Station 46098](http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=46098) which is the buoy deployed by the OOI Cabled Array team. Need to use ["real-time data"](http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/data/realtime2/46098.srad) (defined as in the last 45 days, data in tubalar form) for processing because the solar eclipse was only 10 days ago. I saved the rubalar data into a text file and read/parsed using Python.
- found out that the new sample time stops around 23:54 and therefore there is a gap near midnight everyday --> need to let Skip and Dana know
